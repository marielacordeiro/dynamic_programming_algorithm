# trail of gold algorithm
this is a Python script that solves a pathfinding problem in a grid. 

the script reads a matrix from a file and applies either a recursive algorithm with memoization or a simple recursive algorithm to find the best path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid and outputs the maximum sum of the path found or an error message if no valid path exists. 

the choice between the two algorithms is made by passing a command-line argument when running the script.
